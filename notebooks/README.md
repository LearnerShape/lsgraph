# Example notebooks

These notebooks provide a quick start guide for common steps in building an education or training application with lsgraph. Complete details of the API can be found [here](https://learnershape.com/docs/api).

## Setup

These notebooks require jupyter to run. If you have Python installed running `pip install jupyter` should be sufficient. If you do not have a version of Python installed, the [Ananconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is recommended.
